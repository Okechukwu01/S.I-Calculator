            <h4 class="si">Simple Interest (S.I)</h4>
            <p>Interest is what you pay to paid to a lender when you borrow money. Interest is also what a bank pays you when 
                you put money in savings account. The interest rate is usually shown as a percentage. It is the cost you 
                pay to borrow money or the compensation you receive for lending money. You might pay interest on an auto loan 
                or credit card, or receive interest on cash deposits in interest-bearing accounts, like savings accounts or 
                certificates of deposit (CDs).</p>
            <p>Simple interest (SI) refers to the percentage of interest charged or yielded on the principal sum for a specific period. 
                Borrowed funds (loans), investments, and deposits are considered the principal sum. It is only calculated on the initial 
                sum (the "principal") borrowed or deposited. Generally, simple interest is set as a fixed percentage for the duration of 
                a loan. No matter how often simple interest is calculated, it only applies to this original principal amount. In other 
                words, future interest payments won't be affected by previously accrued interest.</p> 
                <p>keywords: <br>
                    * Simple interest is an interest calculation that does not include compounding interest. <br>
                    * To calculate simple interest, multiply the principal amount by the interest rate and measurement period. <br>
                    * Simple interest works best for making rough estimates, whereas compound interest is more exact. <br>

                <p>To understand the calculations, let us first look at its formula: <br>
                    Here, SI = Simple Interest,<br>
                    * P= Principal Amount,<br>
                    * R= Rate of Interest,<br>
                    * T= Time (in years).<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The elements of SI are explained below: <br>
                    * Principal Amount: It is the sum borrowed, invested, or deposited. <br>
                    * Rate of Interest: The percentage of interest charged from the borrower or offered to the depositor. It is often written as R/100.<br>
                    * Time: The duration for which the SI is to be computed, denoted in years. Say, if the period is in months, then it is 
                    represented as quarters or half-year. It is divided by 12, 4, or 2, respectively. <br>
